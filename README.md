# 🌍 U.S. Carbon Emissions Analysis (EDA)

This repository showcases a data-driven **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project focused on understanding **carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions trends across the United States**. The project draws from publicly available emissions data to extract strategic insights that support **climate action, ESG reporting, and policy development**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

As the urgency to address climate change intensifies, analyzing CO₂ emissions across regions, sectors, and fuel types is critical. This project examines a rich dataset on U.S. emissions over time—identifying patterns by:

- **State**
- **Sector**
- **Fuel type**
- **Year**

The analysis includes both **total** and **average** emissions perspectives to uncover hidden patterns and inform climate-related strategies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📊 Explore **temporal trends** in CO₂ emissions from 2000–2021  
- 🧭 Identify **top-emitting states**, sectors, and fuel sources  
- 🔎 Investigate **sector–fuel relationships** using heatmaps  
- 🗺️ Visualize **geospatial emissions** using choropleth maps
-  ### 🌍 Interactive Choropleth Maps
-  here are the links to choropleth as they were not viewable in the notebook:
- [Average CO₂ Emissions by U.S. State (1970–2021)](https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/avg_emissions_by_state.html)
- [Total CO₂ Emissions by U.S. State (1970–2021)](https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/total_emissions_by_state.html)
- 📌 Deep-dive case study: **Texas emissions breakdown**  
- 🧩 Discover correlations between categorical variables (fuel & sector)

---
## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- **Python** (Pandas)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, **Plotly** (for interactive and static data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (analysis and storytelling)
- **GitHub** (project sharing and version control)
---

## 🛠️ Features

- Cleaned dataset with a custom `wrangle_co2_emissions()` function  
- Dual perspectives: **average vs. total emissions**  
- Comparative side-by-side plots for rich storytelling  
- Sector and fuel-specific time-series trends  
- Interactive **Plotly choropleth** maps for geospatial insight  
- **Correlation heatmaps** of sector–fuel usage relationships  
- Export-ready visualizations for portfolio or reports
---

## 📊 Key Insights

- Petroleum is the dominant fuel source behind emissions in multiple sectors.
- The **Electric Power** and **Transportation** sectors are consistently top emitters.
- **Texas** leads in total emissions across decades, especially from petroleum-based fuels.
- National emissions show cyclical dips around economic downturns and energy reforms.
- Heatmaps and correlation matrices reveal sector-fuel relationships and spatial patterns.
---

## 📌 Possible Future Work

- Build a **dashboard version** of key insights (e.g., Streamlit or Power BI)
- Apply **machine learning models** to forecast emissions by state, sector or fuel type
- Compare with **global emissions data** for broader context
